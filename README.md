Data oriented solution to locating food deserts in underserved urban/rural areas.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert

Use
* Census data
* Commercial zoning data
* Public transportation data
* Health data
 
to identify specific areas of cities where people do not have access to quality food.

Can use this information to do the following
* Supply or create convenient, small, affordable places to buy fresh food.
  * Accessible, properly sized, placed so that it will succeed and serve the neighborhood.
  * Think of a place sized like a 7-11 but not full of garbage
  * These places will be owned by the neighborhood and employ the people in it.
  * Information available in them on basic nutrition.
* Create community gardens to stock these businesses. Look to local sources for as many goods as possible.
* Identify other areas of need. If a person can't get decent food they probably need other assistance and services. Engage the local community to figure this out.
